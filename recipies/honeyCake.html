    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Greek honey cake is a soft, lightly spiced dessert made by mixing flour, yogurt, olive oil, eggs, and cinnamon
        into a smooth batter and baking it until golden. While the cake is still warm, a simple syrup of honey, water,
        and lemon juice is gently poured over the top so it soaks in, making the cake moist and fragrant. Often finished
        with crushed walnuts or an extra drizzle of honey, it has a rich yet comforting sweetness that is simple and
        beautifully Mediterranean.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon
            juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>

        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; set aside.</li>

        <li>Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one
            at a time. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with milk, beating just until incorporated; stir in walnuts.
            Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup
            over cake. For best results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup before slicing and
            serving.</li>

    </ol>
